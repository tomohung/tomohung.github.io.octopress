It's a late post since I got a Rails job for 2 month. I'll share my background and my interview experience, hope it will be helpful if you have the similar background like me.

Background:

- From Taiwan
- Have 8 years for vision inspection machine development, it needs some of coding work by using C++.
- But with NO any experience for web development.
- Seek for a career change from a local-based develop a machine for manufacture industry to a cloud-based develop a user experience service.
- Start Tealeaf course from last December Christmas and finish it in the early May. ( finish the course on schedule)
- Start a Rails working on June.

First, let me show the conclusion first:

- Join Tealeaf Academy is definitely worthy.
- Finish the Interview Prep is definitely worthy.
- Write blog for this course is definitely worthy.

----------

Unfortunately, there're not too much job opportunities in Taiwan. This is true, but on the other hand, there are also not too much people really good at Rails. I mean, Rails is popular and well-known, but most people just finish some tutorials from free course like code school or some one day workshop like Rails girls. What we different is -- this is a great opportunity to show your ambitious why you want to "PAY" for Tealeaf to upgrade your Rails skill. This is always the first question when I talk with interview officer.

I only got 4 interview chances in two month, two of them on April after finishing course 2 and the other two on May after finishing course 3. The Interview Prep is very very very helpful because I am asked for the exactly same questions from there!! Something like security probelm: csrf, authenticity token, or Rails architecture: MVC, OR Mapping, Ruby: polymorphism...etc. Even that example for association of person and children and grandson :-)

Doing Interview Prep is also a good chance to review what I knew and what I don't know. For example: n + 1 queries and eager loading.

Since I'm not a native in English, so choosing a English-based course is also an impressing action. Same for writing blogs what I learned from Tealeaf course. I got an unexpecting interview chance from a foreigner company which offer higher payment than others, just because my blog is impressing to them.

Hope these will be helpful.
