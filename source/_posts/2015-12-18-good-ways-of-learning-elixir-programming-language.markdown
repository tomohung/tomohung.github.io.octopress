Here's how I learned Elixir:

1. Went through this getting started guide on elixir-lang.org
2. Learn Elixir With a Pro - these short screencasts are helpful and show you how to use certain libraries or language features in Elixir
3. Read a book on Elixir - The Pragmatic Bookshelf | Programming Elixir
4. Read a lot of other people's code - I suggest reading Elixir libraries that you would likely use on a day-to-day basis. For me, this was mainly phoenixframework/phoenix and elixir-lang/plug
5.  Write some Elixir code! - I did the exercises on the Programming Elixir book and did some OSS contributions. I'm also building something in Phoenix.
6. Learn Erlang! - The Pragmatic Bookshelf | Programming Erlang

I typically prefer reading a book when learning a new programming language. The structure it provides saves me from a lot of decisions I otherwise would have to make. The Programming Elixir was a great primer and provides a lot of exercises for you to immediately apply what you learn in a chapter. 

After going through the Programming Elixir book, you'll find that a lot of questions about Elixir are unanswered. That's because you'd need to learn yourself some Erlang. Elixir directly benefits from Erlang's properties and its ecosystem so learning Erlang will be really helpful. I found that learning Erlang was easy since a lot of Elixir is inherited from Erlang. Others read the Programming Erlang book simultaneously with Programming Elixir, so you could do it that way if you prefer.

When I feel a little lazy, I watch a screencast or 2 since it doesn't take as much effort compared to reading. I guess it's nice to mix the medium every once in a while.

There's lots of Elixir code in Github to read. Might be best to start with those created by the Elixir core team to see how they would write Elixir. When finding it hard to decide on what to write in Elixir, you could start with small contributions to your favorite Elixir lib. This gives you more to read, but has the added bonus of better understanding a tool you will likely be using.

I hope this was helpful!
