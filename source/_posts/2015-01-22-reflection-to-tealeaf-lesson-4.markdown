To be honest, I still feel uncomfortable with this week. From week 3, I learned html & css, to week 4, I learned jQuery & Ajax. It's definitely not enough only rely on Codecademy's course, so I decide to do one more app, tic-tac-toe on wep. I think this should make me more comfortable with these lessons.

But I'm wrong, ha!! I still get stuck when doing UI and interactive design. Since I already knew that the most important thing at this moment is becoming a robust rails development, I decide to keep my pace and going to next course.

Recap to this course:

- week 1, basic Ruby program.
- week 2, OOP in Ruby.
- week 3, **HTTP is stateless**, HTML & CSS, Sinatra, and Bootstrap.
- week 4, jQuery and Ajax.

One more thing, I thought I could be a full stack web developer before this course, then I knew I'm wrong. There are a lot of knowledge in front end. 

And now I have to keep focus on back end.
