This lesson Tealeaf reveals the `Controller` and `View` part of MVC, I would like to summarize this lessons into two parts: `Don't Repeat Yourself` and `Conventions over Configuration`.

###Don't Repeat Yourself

before_action

form partial

Helpers for view: fix url and datetime

###Conventions over Configuration
CRUD

routes for 7 actions: index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy
nested routes

model backed form

category_ids for checkboxes

###Others

Strong parameters

render vs redirect_to

validations
