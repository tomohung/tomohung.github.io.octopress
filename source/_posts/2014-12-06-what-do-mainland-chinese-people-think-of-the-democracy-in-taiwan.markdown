#大陸人怎麼看台灣民主？

**Feifei Wang**

<!---
Mainland Chinese people have a rather mixed feeling about the democracy in Taiwan, that is, for those small group of intellectuals who do feel something about it. Most people simply don’t care. What does Taiwan have to do with us, other than “they’re part of China”. While it is nice for the Taiwanese to imagine that mainland Chinese actually “envy” their system, it’s no more than a self-indulging illusion.

大陸人有一種混雜的心情看待台灣的民主，就是只有小部份團體會關心它，而大部份的人並不會去關心。台灣會對我們做什麼，或者是台灣是中國的一部份。有時台灣人會想像大陸是一種”邪惡”的系統，但那只不過是種自我安慰罷了。

<!---
There’re a certain group of people who kept a close watch on Taiwan democracy. They’re hoping that they might use Taiwan’s model and do something similar in Mainland China. These are the people who truly have the will (some even have the power) to change. 
-->
有一些保持近距離觀察台灣民主的團體，他們希望台灣民主的模式，也許有些類似的模式可以用在大陸上。他們是真正有願景（有些也有能力）去改變。

<!---
And how they’re disappointed.

然後他們失望了。

Yes, if I have to say what mainland Chinese people think of democracy in Taiwan, I’d say it’s bitter disappointment. So this is what democracy is. People shouting with each other in Legislative Yuan, or having mob fights in congress. And look at the results, the first non-Kuomintang democratically elected president turn out to be a shameless embezzler… and this is what we get to look forward to if we do democracy the same way Taiwan does. 
-->
是的，我必需說大陸人是有在考慮台灣的民主，但我說了這其實有點失望。這就是所謂的民主？人們在立法院互相大吼或者是在議會打架。結果呢，第一個非國民黨的民選總統變成了無恥的貪汙者，這是我們必需考慮如果將來要和台灣走一樣的民主路要面對的情況。

<!--
We have hoped that with Taiwan’s success, we could use it as a strong argument for pushing democracy in China. We could even argue that Taiwan’s economic success during the 80s can be attribute to is democracy (which is, of course, completely not true, but we can argue that). But now, we can’t even use Taiwan, the closest in culture and situation as China, as an example. Because Taiwan had made democracy a laughingstock. Not only its process ridiculous (adult people cursing and get into physical fights), its results are also abysmal (electing a criminal with his entire family involved in embezzlement). 
-->
我們曾渴望像台灣一樣的成功，我們可以用這個來推動中國的民主。我們也可以討論台灣在80年代成功的經濟發展是因為民主推動（當然並不完全是對的，但我們可以討論）。但現在而言，我們無法利用台灣，這個在地理位置或文化上都與中國最相近的國家。舉例來說，因為台灣己經讓民主變成了個笑話。並不只是因為他的過程很滑䅾（成年人互相咒罵和互歐），結果也是糟透了（選了一個和整個家族都牽涉到貪汙）

<!--
Right now, Taiwan probably served as a cautious tale about how democracy could go wrong or how democracy doesn’t really solve the corruption, or the worst “how democracy doesn’t work for China”. (Just look at Taiwan, they say).
-->
現在，也許台灣展示了錯誤的民主之道，民主為何不能實際地解決腐敗，或者更糟的是”為何民主在大陸行不通”（只看現在台灣的話）

<!--
 However, that’s not to say Taiwan democracy is a failure. Personally, I think Taiwan democracy is a success. Embezzler or not, people did come out and casting their votes, and that is important on a principle level. And for people who’re not used to democratic voting system, it is crucial to let them make mistakes and realize “voting have consequences that would impact their own lives”. I’d be more than happy to have a messy democratic congress than a quiet orderly totalitarian one. But you have to admit, it looks pretty bad, and people who’re against democracy can easily dismiss it. 
-->
雖說如此，這並不是說台灣民主是個錯誤。對我個人而言，台灣民主是成功的。無論貪汙與否，人民的確站出來投下一票，而這是重要的原則。而對那些無法利用民主投票系統的人來說，犯錯，並了解到投票是會對人民生活造成影響的。我寧可有一個混亂的民主議會而不要有個僵直老化的極權政府。但你必需承認，它看起來相當糟，而反對民主的人很容易反騻它。

I for one never believe western model of democracy could work in China. We do need democracy but it should be on our own term, and instead of following other people’s model, we should find out own way. As cliche and evil as it might sound, it should be a “Chinese style democracy”.
-->
我是一個從不相信西方民主模型可以在中國應用的人。但我們的確需要民主，但它必需是屬於我們的方式，替代其它模式，我們應該要找出我們自己的路。也許聽起來有點陳腔爛調或厭惡，他應該是”中國式的民主”
