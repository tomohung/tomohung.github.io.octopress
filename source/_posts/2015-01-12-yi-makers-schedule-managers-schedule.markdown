我曾經試過，寫程式最有效率的反而是在假日，可以從早上六點就一直做到晚上十二點（當然中間有被吃飯時間中斷），比起平常日在公司，產出高出好幾倍。所以看到這篇文章心有戚戚焉。

<!--
One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they're on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more.
-->
對程式員來說不喜歡開會的原因之一，是因為他們和其它人平同的行程安排類型。

開會的代價更大。

<!--
There are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule. The manager's schedule is for bosses. It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you're doing every hour.
-->

有兩種行程安排類型，管理者行程和製造者行程。管理者行程是給老闆用的，它是傳統上指派任務，每天把時間切成數個小時片段，你可以指派任務給其中幾個小時，但原則上，每個小時要做的事情都不一樣。
<!--more-->

<!--
When you use time that way, it's merely a practical problem to meet with someone. Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and you're done.
-->

當你用這種方式時，就是一個很務實處理與人會面的問題。找一個空白的時段，註記起來，然後就完成了。

<!--
Most powerful people are on the manager's schedule. It's the schedule of command. But there's another way of using time that's common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can't write or program well in units of an hour. That's barely enough time to get started.
-->

很多有能力的人都是管理者類型。這是一種命令的安排。但對於製造產品，像是程式員和作家，還有另一種方式。他們通常時間的單位，傾向至少半天的區塊。你不能寫作或是寫程式用一個小時當單位。那只夠時間做個開頭而己。


<!--
When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. That's no problem for someone on the manager's schedule. There's always something coming on the next hour; the only question is what. But when someone on the maker's schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.
-->

當你處於製造者模式時，會議是個災難。一個會議就可以毀掉整個下午，時間切的零碎以致於很難做任何事。再加上你必需記住要去開會，這對管理者模型的人不是問題，他們總是在準備下一個小時要做的事，問題只是要處理的是什麼。但如果是製造者模式的人有一個會議，他們就必需掛念著它。


<!--
For someone on the maker's schedule, having a meeting is like throwing an exception. It doesn't merely cause you to switch from one task to another; it changes the mode in which you work.
-->

對於在製造者模式的人，有一個會議就像程式上丟出一個例外，它不只讓你轉換到另一個工作，同時他也改變你工作的型態。


<!--
I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day. A meeting commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or afternoon. But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect. If I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I'm slightly less likely to start something ambitious in the morning. I know this may sound oversensitive, but if you're a maker, think of your own case. Don't your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire day free to work, with no appointments at all? Well, that means your spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don't. And ambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your capacity. A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.
-->

我發現有時候一個會議可以影響一整天。至少毀了半天，早上或下什。另外附加的是有時候還會有階層效應。如果我知道下午會被切開，在早上我就會有點不想做任何事。我知道這聽起來有點過於敏感，但如果你也是製造者模式的人，想想你自己，你內心沒有出現一個想要可以有一整天工作，沒有任何約會的想法嗎？好吧，那表示你的內心在你不想的時候做出調適。一個有野心的計劃一定是非常接近你能力的極限，一個小小精神能力䧏低就足夠毀掉它們。

<!--
Each type of schedule works fine by itself. Problems arise when they meet. Since most powerful people operate on the manager's schedule, they're in a position to make everyone resonate at their frequency if they want to. But the smarter ones restrain themselves, if they know that some of the people working for them need long chunks of time to work in.
-->

兩種工作型式都很好，問題出在它們相遇的時候。既然大多數強力的管理者都使用管理者模式，他們必需讓每個人都配合他們工作的頻率，但是有些聽明的人不來這套，因為他們知道有些人就是需要足夠的大區塊時間來工作。

<!--
Our case is an unusual one. Nearly all investors, including all VCs I know, operate on the manager's schedule. But Y Combinator runs on the maker's schedule. Rtm and Trevor and I do because we always have, and Jessica does too, mostly, because she's gotten into sync with us.
-->

我們是一個不尋常的例子，幾乎所有投資人，包括創投基金，都是使用管理者模式。但是Y combinator是使用製造者模式。Rtm和Trvor和我都是，因為我們喜歡如此，還有Jessica也是如此，因為她必需和我們同步配合。

<!--
I wouldn't be surprised if there start to be more companies like us. I suspect founders may increasingly be able to resist, or at least postpone, turning into managers, just as a few decades ago they started to be able to resist switching from jeans to suits.
-->

如果有愈來愈多的公司和我們一樣，我也不會感到驚訝。我猜創業的人應該也開始會拒絕，或者說延遲同步到管理者模式。就像十幾年前他們開始排斥從襯杉轉換到穿牛仔褲。

<!--
How do we manage to advise so many startups on the maker's schedule? By using the classic device for simulating the manager's schedule within the maker's: office hours. Several times a week I set aside a chunk of time to meet founders we've funded. These chunks of time are at the end of my working day, and I wrote a signup program that ensures all the appointments within a given set of office hours are clustered at the end. Because they come at the end of my day these meetings are never an interruption. (Unless their working day ends at the same time as mine, the meeting presumably interrupts theirs, but since they made the appointment it must be worth it to them.) During busy periods, office hours sometimes get long enough that they compress the day, but they never interrupt it.
-->

那我們如何給那些製造者模式的新創團隊建議？經典的老方法，office hours。一週數次，我安排一個大區塊時間來看創辦人見面。這些時間都在我完成一天的工作後，我寫了一個登錄的程式來確保所有的約會都在一天的最後聚集起來。因為這些約會都在一天的最後，所以從來沒打斷我。（除非他們的工作時間和我一樣，不然會議通常會打斷他們自己的，不過既然他們約了這個會，我想對他們這是值得的）。當忙碌的時候，office hours有時候就顯得會壓縮到那天，但他們不會打斷它。

<!--
When we were working on our own startup, back in the 90s, I evolved another trick for partitioning the day. I used to program from dinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could interrupt me. Then I'd sleep till about 11 am, and come in and work until dinner on what I called "business stuff." I never thought of it in these terms, but in effect I had two workdays each day, one on the manager's schedule and one on the maker's.
-->

當我們在90年代創業的時候，我用另一個技巧來把一天分隔開。我通常在晚餐後寫程式寫到半夜三點，因為在晚上沒有人可以打擾我。然後我睡到早上十一點，繼續工作到晚餐，這段時間我叫它做商業工作。我沒有想過這，但我把一天分成兩個工作天，一個是管理者模式，一個是製造者模式。

<!--
When you're operating on the manager's schedule you can do something you'd never want to do on the maker's: you can have speculative meetings. You can meet someone just to get to know one another. If you have an empty slot in your schedule, why not? Maybe it will turn out you can help one another in some way.
-->

當你在管理者模式時你會做些你在製造者模式時不會做的事：觀察式約會。你可以和一些人見面僅只是要互相認識。如果你有一個空檔，為何不？或許有一天它會轉換成讓你幫助另一個人。

<!--
Business people in Silicon Valley (and the whole world, for that matter) have speculative meetings all the time. They're effectively free if you're on the manager's schedule. They're so common that there's distinctive language for proposing them: saying that you want to "grab coffee," for example.
-->

在矽谷的生意人（也可以說全世界有同樣問題的）總是在觀察式的約會。如果在管理者模式這是很有效率的。這是很普通的，有一句特別的代名詞可以表達：來杯咖啡吧！

<!--
Speculative meetings are terribly costly if you're on the maker's schedule, though. Which puts us in something of a bind. Everyone assumes that, like other investors, we run on the manager's schedule. So they introduce us to someone they think we ought to meet, or send us an email proposing we grab coffee. At this point we have two options, neither of them good: we can meet with them, and lose half a day's work; or we can try to avoid meeting them, and probably offend them.
-->

如果你是在製造者模式時，觀察式約會就變得很糟，讓我們被某個東西綁住。所有像那些投資人都假設，我們是在管理者模式。所以當他們要介紹某些我們應該要會面的人，或者是發封郵件來提議來杯咖啡吧，當這個時候我們有兩個選擇，兩個都不大好：去會面，但是損失半天的工作時間；或是拒絕會面但是可能會冒犯到他們。

<!--
Till recently we weren't clear in our own minds about the source of the problem. We just took it for granted that we had to either blow our schedules or offend people. But now that I've realized what's going on, perhaps there's a third option: to write something explaining the two types of schedule. Maybe eventually, if the conflict between the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule starts to be more widely understood, it will become less of a problem.
-->

直到最近我們還不能搞清楚問題的核心，我們只能打斷工作或是冒犯別人。但現在我己經了解到為什麼了，也許有一個第三個選擇方案：寫下來解譯這兩種模式。也許最後，管理者模式和製造者模式的不同會愈來愈多人知道，那這個問題就會少發生了。

<!--
Those of us on the maker's schedule are willing to compromise. We know we have to have some number of meetings. All we ask from those on the manager's schedule is that they understand the cost.
-->

那些希望我們這種製造者模式的人要妥協的，也知道我們必需去參加些會議，我們希望的只是那些管理者模式的人，知道這些會議背後的代價。
