#為什麼軟體工程師可以賺這麼多錢？
##問：

<!--
In California, the average software engineer at a tech startup makes well over $100k/year. And that's when they're fresh out of college. 

Why? I'm guessing it's because of supply/demand and there's a shortage of software engineers.

With so many students pursuing careers in software engineering today, do you see salaries going significantly down in the future? By how much would you say?
-->
在加州，軟體工程師在新創團隊年薪可超過10萬。而且這還是他們剛踏出校園的水準。

為什麼？我猜這是因為供給需求，而軟體工程師很少。
隨著愈來愈多學生投入軟體工程的今天，你可以預見在未來薪水會明顯的減少嗎？又會少到什麼程度呢？

That's actually not that high. Housing is considered affordable at 24-30% of a person's annual income. That means that, at $100,000 per year, you can afford up to $2,000 to $2,500 per month. What can you get in San Francisco for $2,500? Or New York? You can get a decent studio or 1BR, but raising a family is impossible. Even in the Valley, what kind of house would you be able to get on a $2,500 mortgage?

實際上並沒有這麼高。住的花費大概會佔掉一個人大約24-30%的年收入。這表示，年收入10萬，你可以負擔2000-2500每個月的房租。只有2500要怎麼在舊金山生活？或者是紐約？你可以有一個工作室，或是一個小套房，但如果是一個家庭的話，不可能。甚至在矽谷，什麼樣的房子可以只用2500就能貨款買到？

In 1999, $100,000 was considered typical for a good software engineer in the Bay Area or New York, and $160,000 (plus equity, and not the 0.02% bullshit you see now) for a top-notch one. Those numbers, in 2014 dollars, would be $143,000 (on the high-end of the engineer pay scale) and $228,000 (unheard-of for a non-management corporate drone). Inflation adjusted, the picture has become worse-- moreso if you include increased costs of housing, health insurance, and the like. 

Software engineers aren't a privileged set. They're just less fucked than the rest of the U.S. Former Middle Class.

在1999年，年收入10萬被認為是一個在灣區或是紐約好的軟體工程師的收入，而年收入16萬（是平均以上，而不是現在你看到那些前面0.02%）是屬於頂尖水準。這些數字在2014年時，只值14萬3千鎂（屬於高端工程師的薪水）而22萬8千元（沒聽過非管理階級可以拿到）。通貨膨漲正在進行，而景像看起來是愈來愈糟，包括居住，保險等等。


<!--
Additionally, the income trajectory of a software engineer flattens out very quickly. The Bay Area software engineer may start at $100,000, but to get to $150,000 usually requires moving into management. Moreover, the software industry is fighting a paradox-of-plenty; because the victories are so remunerative (to the business, not the engineers) this industry allows an incredible amount of mismanagement. So that (software management) is a harrowing, un-fun path to take with a high burn-out rate. Executive and founder roles at startups are what bottom-10% McKinseys and Goldmanites fail into. Software engineers eventually get sick of answering to idiots and burn out, and if you rise into middle-management, you're in the even-worse position of having to motivate smart people to answer to idiots you pretend to respect because it's your job. 

-->

另外，軟體工程師收入扁平化非常快。灣區的軟體工程師可能起薪是年薪10萬，但想拿到15萬通常必需要轉管理職。此外軟體工程正在對抗兩難的困境，因為贏者的報酬極高（商業而言，而不是工程師而言），這個產業允許大量不當的管理。所以（軟體管理）是一個不有趣，替換率很高的工作。管理階級和創辦人扮演著新創公司時最底層的那10%。軟體工程師最後會厭煩回答那些白痴的問題，而且如果你晉升到了中階管理階層，情況只會更糟，因為你必需要鞭策那些聰明的人去回答那些你假裝尊敬的白痴問題，只因為就是你的工作。

<!--
Finally, there's the age discrimination. Few educated people consider the median major league athlete overpaid, considering the short length of that career. Now, it takes decades to become a great programmer, but great programmers tend to be older (with a few exceptions, late 30s at least) and the Valley doesn't like age. (It also, for the most part, doesn't have much demand for great programmers. For most of these bullshit products, clueless young people will do.) If you can become a consultant, you can have a pretty good life for yourself, but that requires an entirely different skill set that a corporate job won't teach you. If you find your way into a research group, you can offset the age penalty (because R&D people actually get intellectually stimulating work and don't turn into zombies or executives by 35) but that tends to require a PhD. Or, there's management, but I already addressed the negatives of that path. 

This idea that software salaries are "crazy" is not only inaccurate, but deeply harmful. It needs to end now.
  
-->
最後，還存在年齡的歧視。少數受過教育的人認為中等程度學校畢業的人，考慮短短的職涯，薪水超過應拿的水準。現在，要成為一位很棒的程式工程師必需花十年以上，但好的工程師愈來愈老（少部份例外，不到30歲）而矽谷不喜歡有年紀的人。（這也代表，在大部份的時候，沒有高階工程師的需求）如果你成為了一位顧問，你可以過著很好的生活，但這需要完全不同的技能而這些在公司的工作不會教你。如果你找到了研究單位的工作，你可以延後年齡的問題（因為研發的通常很自發性的聰明工作也不會35歲就變成像僵屍一樣。但趨勢表示你需要有一個博士學位。或者，轉管理職，但我己經說明了這條路的負面影響。

關於說軟體工程師薪水多好多好是一件瘋狂的事，並不準確且傷人。停止謠言吧。
