#IQ150的人是怎樣的體驗，是否生活變成很輕鬆？

**Kerry Watson**

<!---
I was once married to a man with an IQ of 170. After we broke up he was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and ADD. Life is in no way easier; in many ways it is far more difficult. Nobody seems logical; everything and everyone is a shade of gray, nothing is black and white. Even easy decisions get mired in possibilities.

我曾經嫁給一位IQ170的人。之後我們離婚因為他患有愛斯柏格症Asperger syndrome和注意力不足過動症ADD。生活沒有更輕鬆，而是再困難不過的事了。沒有人看起來是有邏輯性的，任何東西和任何人都是黑暗的陰影，沒有黑白對錯。甚至簡單的決擇都有可能變成一團亂。

Sure, work is super-easy, but it’s also boring and hard to find real challenges, and one gets mired in the politics that are illogical and emotional and downright stupid. His difficulty in life was trying to reduce everything to a model. Of course the world cannot be reduced to a model. In a discussion, he would try to define the criteria by which to judge the discussion (the model), then he would “win” because he had defined them. Most people didn’t catch on to this. And nobody gets issued common sense to go with a high IQ. The two might even be inversely correlated.

當然，工作是超級簡單，但它也令人覺得無聊也找不到真正值得挑戰的目標，一個人陷入非理性的情緒時完全變成個傻瓜。他的為難點就是在生活中把任何的事情都要歸納出一個模型。當然，世界並沒有辦法簡單的縮減成一個模型。在模型的討論中，也許他會”贏”，是因為他老早就定義這些模型了。大部份的人並無法理解這件事，也沒有人會對這種常識發出疑問。這兩件事甚至是相反的關係。

EDIT: I have an IQ of 140, and since IQ can vary by 20 points so I’ll tell you about me. Obviously I still take things too literally. Intelligence does not give you insight into yourself. My mother did not believe in revealing my IQ because she thought it would  “go to my head” so I didn’t know I was intelligent until I was an adult.  I started school at age 4 and 6 weeks, yet my friends were always several years ahead of me. From this I developed a self-image of being short and immature, even though today I am neither. In sixth grade I tried to read every adult book in the local public library, about one per day. I tested for the Air Force in the top 2% for linguistic ability and became a linguist.

補充：我自己是IQ140，既然IQ的值變動大約上下20點，所以我可以說說我自己。明顯的，我處理事情仍然是一件一件的來。聰明並無法讓你看穿自己的內心。我媽從不相信我的高IQ，因為他說過這會讓我自負，所以我一直到成人才了解到這件事。我在4歲又6個月的時候上學，但我們朋友們總是都比我大好幾歲。因此我成長的環境總是帶著自己較矮小和不成熟的印像，甚至一直到今天都是。六年級的時候，我試著在圖書館一天一本地閱讀所有的成年書籍。我曾做過語言學的空軍測試，排名前2%，並成為了一位語言學者。

I can do pretty much anything I put my mind to, so at times I took on far more than any one human being should do. I worked full time, and went to college, and raised a daughter, and built a house with my hands all at the same time. I have skydived, finished the San Francisco marathon, raced cars at famous road tracks and was even a track instructor for car clubs for several years. I scuba dive, ride a motorcycle and ride horses. I have a lot of kinesthetic intelligence as well as linguistic.

我可以同時處理在大腦中的好幾件事，所以可以在同時間內完成遠超過一位正常人可以做的事。我全職工作並去大學（上課），扶養一位女兒，同時維持一個家庭。我曾高空跳傘，完成舊金山馬拉松，在知名的賽道上賽車，也曾在一個車子俱樂部擔任好幾年的指導員。我也會潛水，騎摩托車，騎馬。我也有著運動肌能學習一樣的天份在語言學上。

Work-wise I have mostly worked with lawyers and techies because I like being around smart people.  I earned an MBA and owned my own business for much of my life. I worked myself nearly to death because I loved the rewards, I worked for a few wonderful companies that were meritocracies and I was like a rat hitting the bar for a pellet.

工作的時候我大部份都和律師和科技人一起工作，因為我喜歡和聰明人一起。我得到MBA學位，也有自己的生意。我把自己操到極限因為我喜歡最後的回報，我幫幾個很棒的精英公司工作，這完全出於自願。

I am easily able to translate technical subjects into plain language and have been a technical writer for the last ten years. In 2003 I wrote the first book on osCommerce, an open source e-commerce program, and have continued to write books on various open source e-commerce programs because it is easy and rewarding for me.

我可以輕鬆的用簡潔的語言來翻譯技術文章，也成為一位科技作家在過去十年。在2003年，我寫了第一本書關於osCommerce，是一本開源的電子商務程式，並持續地寫作更多不同開源式的電子商務程式，因為它對我來說是簡單並且可以得到回報的。
