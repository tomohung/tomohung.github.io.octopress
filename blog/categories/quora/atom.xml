<h1>為什麼軟體工程師可以賺這麼多錢？</h1>

<h2>問：</h2>

<!--
In California, the average software engineer at a tech startup makes well over $100k/year. And that's when they're fresh out of college. 

Why? I'm guessing it's because of supply/demand and there's a shortage of software engineers.

With so many students pursuing careers in software engineering today, do you see salaries going significantly down in the future? By how much would you say?
-->


<p>在加州，軟體工程師在新創團隊年薪可超過10萬。而且這還是他們剛踏出校園的水準。</p>

<p>為什麼？我猜這是因為供給需求，而軟體工程師很少。
隨著愈來愈多學生投入軟體工程的今天，你可以預見在未來薪水會明顯的減少嗎？又會少到什麼程度呢？</p>

<h2>答：</h2>

<p><strong>Michael O. Church</strong></p>

<!--
That's actually not that high. Housing is considered affordable at 24-30% of a person's annual income. That means that, at $100,000 per year, you can afford up to $2,000 to $2,500 per month. What can you get in San Francisco for $2,500? Or New York? You can get a decent studio or 1BR, but raising a family is impossible. Even in the Valley, what kind of house would you be able to get on a $2,500 mortgage?
-->


<p>實際上並沒有這麼高。住的花費大概會佔掉一個人大約24-30%的年收入。這表示，年收入10萬，你可以負擔2000-2500每個月的房租。只有2500要怎麼在舊金山生活？或者是紐約？你可以有一個工作室，或是一個小套房，但如果是一個家庭的話，不可能。甚至在矽谷，什麼樣的房子可以只用2500就能貨款買到？</p>

<!--more-->




<!--
In 1999, $100,000 was considered typical for a good software engineer in the Bay Area or New York, and $160,000 (plus equity, and not the 0.02% bullshit you see now) for a top-notch one. Those numbers, in 2014 dollars, would be $143,000 (on the high-end of the engineer pay scale) and $228,000 (unheard-of for a non-management corporate drone). Inflation adjusted, the picture has become worse-- moreso if you include increased costs of housing, health insurance, and the like. 

Software engineers aren't a privileged set. They're just less fucked than the rest of the U.S. Former Middle Class.
-->


<p>在1999年，年收入10萬被認為是一個在灣區或是紐約好的軟體工程師的收入，而年收入16萬（是平均以上，而不是現在你看到那些前面0.02%）是屬於頂尖水準。這些數字在2014年時，只值14萬3千鎂（屬於高端工程師的薪水）而22萬8千元（沒聽過非管理階級可以拿到）。通貨膨漲正在進行，而景像看起來是愈來愈糟，包括居住，保險等等。</p>

<!--
Additionally, the income trajectory of a software engineer flattens out very quickly. The Bay Area software engineer may start at $100,000, but to get to $150,000 usually requires moving into management. Moreover, the software industry is fighting a paradox-of-plenty; because the victories are so remunerative (to the business, not the engineers) this industry allows an incredible amount of mismanagement. So that (software management) is a harrowing, un-fun path to take with a high burn-out rate. Executive and founder roles at startups are what bottom-10% McKinseys and Goldmanites fail into. Software engineers eventually get sick of answering to idiots and burn out, and if you rise into middle-management, you're in the even-worse position of having to motivate smart people to answer to idiots you pretend to respect because it's your job. 

-->


<p>另外，軟體工程師收入扁平化非常快。灣區的軟體工程師可能起薪是年薪10萬，但想拿到15萬通常必需要轉管理職。此外軟體工程正在對抗兩難的困境，因為贏者的報酬極高（商業而言，而不是工程師而言），這個產業允許大量不當的管理。所以（軟體管理）是一個不有趣，替換率很高的工作。管理階級和創辦人扮演著新創公司時最底層的那10%。軟體工程師最後會厭煩回答那些白痴的問題，而且如果你晉升到了中階管理階層，情況只會更糟，因為你必需要鞭策那些聰明的人去回答那些你假裝尊敬的白痴問題，只因為就是你的工作。</p>

<!--
Finally, there's the age discrimination. Few educated people consider the median major league athlete overpaid, considering the short length of that career. Now, it takes decades to become a great programmer, but great programmers tend to be older (with a few exceptions, late 30s at least) and the Valley doesn't like age. (It also, for the most part, doesn't have much demand for great programmers. For most of these bullshit products, clueless young people will do.) If you can become a consultant, you can have a pretty good life for yourself, but that requires an entirely different skill set that a corporate job won't teach you. If you find your way into a research group, you can offset the age penalty (because R&D people actually get intellectually stimulating work and don't turn into zombies or executives by 35) but that tends to require a PhD. Or, there's management, but I already addressed the negatives of that path. 

This idea that software salaries are "crazy" is not only inaccurate, but deeply harmful. It needs to end now.
  
-->


<p>最後，還存在年齡的歧視。少數受過教育的人認為中等程度學校畢業的人，考慮短短的職涯，薪水超過應拿的水準。現在，要成為一位很棒的程式工程師必需花十年以上，但好的工程師愈來愈老（少部份例外，不到30歲）而矽谷不喜歡有年紀的人。（這也代表，在大部份的時候，沒有高階工程師的需求）如果你成為了一位顧問，你可以過著很好的生活，但這需要完全不同的技能而這些在公司的工作不會教你。如果你找到了研究單位的工作，你可以延後年齡的問題（因為研發的通常很自發性的聰明工作也不會35歲就變成像僵屍一樣。但趨勢表示你需要有一個博士學位。或者，轉管理職，但我己經說明了這條路的負面影響。</p>

<p>關於說軟體工程師薪水多好多好是一件瘋狂的事，並不準確且傷人。停止謠言吧。</p>

<h1>大陸人怎麼看台灣民主？</h1>

<p><strong>Feifei Wang</strong></p>

<!---
Mainland Chinese people have a rather mixed feeling about the democracy in Taiwan, that is, for those small group of intellectuals who do feel something about it. Most people simply don’t care. What does Taiwan have to do with us, other than “they’re part of China”. While it is nice for the Taiwanese to imagine that mainland Chinese actually “envy” their system, it’s no more than a self-indulging illusion. 
-->


<p>大陸人有一種混雜的心情看待台灣的民主，就是只有小部份團體會關心它，而大部份的人並不會去關心。台灣會對我們做什麼，或者是台灣是中國的一部份。有時台灣人會想像大陸是一種”邪惡”的系統，但那只不過是種自我安慰罷了。</p>

<!---
There’re a certain group of people who kept a close watch on Taiwan democracy. They’re hoping that they might use Taiwan’s model and do something similar in Mainland China. These are the people who truly have the will (some even have the power) to change. 
-->


<p>有一些保持近距離觀察台灣民主的團體，他們希望台灣民主的模式，也許有些類似的模式可以用在大陸上。他們是真正有願景（有些也有能力）去改變。</p>

<!---
And how they’re disappointed. 
-->


<p>然後他們失望了。</p>

<!--more-->




<!--
Yes, if I have to say what mainland Chinese people think of democracy in Taiwan, I’d say it’s bitter disappointment. So this is what democracy is. People shouting with each other in Legislative Yuan, or having mob fights in congress. And look at the results, the first non-Kuomintang democratically elected president turn out to be a shameless embezzler… and this is what we get to look forward to if we do democracy the same way Taiwan does. 
-->


<p>是的，我必需說大陸人是有在考慮台灣的民主，但我說了這其實有點失望。這就是所謂的民主？人們在立法院互相大吼或者是在議會打架。結果呢，第一個非國民黨的民選總統變成了無恥的貪汙者，這是我們必需考慮如果將來要和台灣走一樣的民主路要面對的情況。</p>

<!--
We have hoped that with Taiwan’s success, we could use it as a strong argument for pushing democracy in China. We could even argue that Taiwan’s economic success during the 80s can be attribute to is democracy (which is, of course, completely not true, but we can argue that). But now, we can’t even use Taiwan, the closest in culture and situation as China, as an example. Because Taiwan had made democracy a laughingstock. Not only its process ridiculous (adult people cursing and get into physical fights), its results are also abysmal (electing a criminal with his entire family involved in embezzlement). 
-->


<p>我們曾渴望像台灣一樣的成功，我們可以用這個來推動中國的民主。我們也可以討論台灣在80年代成功的經濟發展是因為民主推動（當然並不完全是對的，但我們可以討論）。但現在而言，我們無法利用台灣，這個在地理位置或文化上都與中國最相近的國家。舉例來說，因為台灣己經讓民主變成了個笑話。並不只是因為他的過程很滑䅾（成年人互相咒罵和互歐），結果也是糟透了（選了一個和整個家族都牽涉到貪汙）</p>

<!--
Right now, Taiwan probably served as a cautious tale about how democracy could go wrong or how democracy doesn’t really solve the corruption, or the worst “how democracy doesn’t work for China”. (Just look at Taiwan, they say).
-->


<p>現在，也許台灣展示了錯誤的民主之道，民主為何不能實際地解決腐敗，或者更糟的是”為何民主在大陸行不通”（只看現在台灣的話）</p>

<!--
 However, that’s not to say Taiwan democracy is a failure. Personally, I think Taiwan democracy is a success. Embezzler or not, people did come out and casting their votes, and that is important on a principle level. And for people who’re not used to democratic voting system, it is crucial to let them make mistakes and realize “voting have consequences that would impact their own lives”. I’d be more than happy to have a messy democratic congress than a quiet orderly totalitarian one. But you have to admit, it looks pretty bad, and people who’re against democracy can easily dismiss it. 
-->


<p>雖說如此，這並不是說台灣民主是個錯誤。對我個人而言，台灣民主是成功的。無論貪汙與否，人民的確站出來投下一票，而這是重要的原則。而對那些無法利用民主投票系統的人來說，犯錯，並了解到投票是會對人民生活造成影響的。我寧可有一個混亂的民主議會而不要有個僵直老化的極權政府。但你必需承認，它看起來相當糟，而反對民主的人很容易反騻它。</p>

<p>(update thanks to Fu Xing Liu and Don Johnson)</p>

<!--
I for one never believe western model of democracy could work in China. We do need democracy but it should be on our own term, and instead of following other people’s model, we should find out own way. As cliche and evil as it might sound, it should be a “Chinese style democracy”.
-->


<p>我是一個從不相信西方民主模型可以在中國應用的人。但我們的確需要民主，但它必需是屬於我們的方式，替代其它模式，我們應該要找出我們自己的路。也許聽起來有點陳腔爛調或厭惡，他應該是”中國式的民主”</p>

<h1>IQ150的人是怎樣的體驗，是否生活變成很輕鬆？</h1>

<p><strong>Kerry Watson</strong></p>

<!---
I was once married to a man with an IQ of 170. After we broke up he was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and ADD. Life is in no way easier; in many ways it is far more difficult. Nobody seems logical; everything and everyone is a shade of gray, nothing is black and white. Even easy decisions get mired in possibilities.
-->


<p>我曾經嫁給一位IQ170的人。之後我們離婚因為他患有愛斯柏格症Asperger syndrome和注意力不足過動症ADD。生活沒有更輕鬆，而是再困難不過的事了。沒有人看起來是有邏輯性的，任何東西和任何人都是黑暗的陰影，沒有黑白對錯。甚至簡單的決擇都有可能變成一團亂。</p>

<!---
Sure, work is super-easy, but it’s also boring and hard to find real challenges, and one gets mired in the politics that are illogical and emotional and downright stupid. His difficulty in life was trying to reduce everything to a model. Of course the world cannot be reduced to a model. In a discussion, he would try to define the criteria by which to judge the discussion (the model), then he would “win” because he had defined them. Most people didn’t catch on to this. And nobody gets issued common sense to go with a high IQ. The two might even be inversely correlated.
-->


<p>當然，工作是超級簡單，但它也令人覺得無聊也找不到真正值得挑戰的目標，一個人陷入非理性的情緒時完全變成個傻瓜。他的為難點就是在生活中把任何的事情都要歸納出一個模型。當然，世界並沒有辦法簡單的縮減成一個模型。在模型的討論中，也許他會”贏”，是因為他老早就定義這些模型了。大部份的人並無法理解這件事，也沒有人會對這種常識發出疑問。這兩件事甚至是相反的關係。</p>

<!--more-->




<!---
EDIT: I have an IQ of 140, and since IQ can vary by 20 points so I’ll tell you about me. Obviously I still take things too literally. Intelligence does not give you insight into yourself. My mother did not believe in revealing my IQ because she thought it would  “go to my head” so I didn’t know I was intelligent until I was an adult.  I started school at age 4 and 6 weeks, yet my friends were always several years ahead of me. From this I developed a self-image of being short and immature, even though today I am neither. In sixth grade I tried to read every adult book in the local public library, about one per day. I tested for the Air Force in the top 2% for linguistic ability and became a linguist. 
-->


<p>補充：我自己是IQ140，既然IQ的值變動大約上下20點，所以我可以說說我自己。明顯的，我處理事情仍然是一件一件的來。聰明並無法讓你看穿自己的內心。我媽從不相信我的高IQ，因為他說過這會讓我自負，所以我一直到成人才了解到這件事。我在4歲又6個月的時候上學，但我們朋友們總是都比我大好幾歲。因此我成長的環境總是帶著自己較矮小和不成熟的印像，甚至一直到今天都是。六年級的時候，我試著在圖書館一天一本地閱讀所有的成年書籍。我曾做過語言學的空軍測試，排名前2%，並成為了一位語言學者。</p>

<!---
I can do pretty much anything I put my mind to, so at times I took on far more than any one human being should do. I worked full time, and went to college, and raised a daughter, and built a house with my hands all at the same time. I have skydived, finished the San Francisco marathon, raced cars at famous road tracks and was even a track instructor for car clubs for several years. I scuba dive, ride a motorcycle and ride horses. I have a lot of kinesthetic intelligence as well as linguistic.
-->


<p>我可以同時處理在大腦中的好幾件事，所以可以在同時間內完成遠超過一位正常人可以做的事。我全職工作並去大學（上課），扶養一位女兒，同時維持一個家庭。我曾高空跳傘，完成舊金山馬拉松，在知名的賽道上賽車，也曾在一個車子俱樂部擔任好幾年的指導員。我也會潛水，騎摩托車，騎馬。我也有著運動肌能學習一樣的天份在語言學上。</p>

<!---
Work-wise I have mostly worked with lawyers and techies because I like being around smart people.  I earned an MBA and owned my own business for much of my life. I worked myself nearly to death because I loved the rewards, I worked for a few wonderful companies that were meritocracies and I was like a rat hitting the bar for a pellet. 
-->


<p>工作的時候我大部份都和律師和科技人一起工作，因為我喜歡和聰明人一起。我得到MBA學位，也有自己的生意。我把自己操到極限因為我喜歡最後的回報，我幫幾個很棒的精英公司工作，這完全出於自願。</p>

<!---
I am easily able to translate technical subjects into plain language and have been a technical writer for the last ten years. In 2003 I wrote the first book on osCommerce, an open source e-commerce program, and have continued to write books on various open source e-commerce programs because it is easy and rewarding for me.
-->


<p>我可以輕鬆的用簡潔的語言來翻譯技術文章，也成為一位科技作家在過去十年。在2003年，我寫了第一本書關於osCommerce，是一本開源的電子商務程式，並持續地寫作更多不同開源式的電子商務程式，因為它對我來說是簡單並且可以得到回報的。<br/>
