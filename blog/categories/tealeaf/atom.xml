    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Answer these quizzes, then updated after watching solution.</p>

<h5>1. Why do they call it a relational database?</h5>

<p>  Relational database can store the relationship between data and data. For example, a table store customer&rsquo;s info, and a table store consuming record, these two table can be associated with another table, to establish the customer&rsquo;s consuming history. There are relationships between data and data in relational database. ex. sqlite, MySQL, PostgreSQL ect.</p>

<h5>2. What is SQL?</h5>

<p>  SQL(Structured Query Language), it&rsquo;s domain specific language to manipulate database.</p>

<!--more-->


<h5>3. There are two predominant views into a relational database. What are they, and how are they different?</h5>

<p>  There are two associations concepts in relational database:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1:M
<strong>One to Many</strong> makes target object can associate with many other objects, like one customer can have many consuming records, we can track the customer&rsquo;s consuming history with this association or we can track the record is generated by which customer.</p></li>
<li><p>M:M
<strong>Many to Many</strong> makes target objects can associate with many other objects, like posts can be assign to many categories, and category can assign to many poasts. We also can track target post or target category is assigned to which one.</p></li>
</ul>


<h5>4. In a table, what do we call the column that serves as the main identifier for a row of data? We&rsquo;re looking for the general database term, not the column name.</h5>

<p>  Attributes. Column indicate that what the row values mean.</p>

<h5>5. What is a foreign key, and how is it used?</h5>

<p>  Every row data in a table is included a <strong>primary key</strong>. If we want to associated with other table, we need this primary key to store which row data we wanna to be connected with this one. The store primary key value&rsquo;s column is called <strong>foreign key</strong>.</p>

<h5>6. At a high level, describe the ActiveRecord pattern. This has nothing to do with Rails, but the actual pattern that ActiveRecord uses to perform its ORM duties.</h5>

<p>  ActiveRecord is mapping the data operation in tables. It substitutes SQL operation and using migration files to define &amp; operate table column.</p>

<h5>7. If there&rsquo;s an ActiveRecord model called &ldquo;CrazyMonkey&rdquo;, what should the table name be?</h5>

<p>  If I&rsquo;m confused with this, I can use <code>rails console</code> mode, to run</p>

<pre><code>"CrazyMonkey".tableize
</code></pre>

<p>  and the answer should be <code>crazy_monkeys</code>.</p>

<h5>8. If I&rsquo;m building a 1:M association between Project and Issue, what will the model associations and foreign key be?</h5>

<p>  in model files
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class Project ActiveRecord::Base
</span><span class='line'>  has_many :issues
</span><span class='line'>end&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p&gt;class Issue ActiveRecord::Base
</span><span class='line'>  belongs_to :project
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>  in migration files
<code>
class CreateIssue ActiveRecord:Migration
  def change
    create_table :issues do |t|
      t.integer :project_id
    end
  end
</code></p>

<h5>9. Given this code</h5>

<pre><code>class Zoo &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :animals
end
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>What do you expect the other model to be and what does database schema look like?</li>
</ul>


<p>  There should be antoher class named &ldquo;Animal&rdquo;, and it belongs to Zoo. Animal should at least have name, and a foriegn key to set to zoo id.</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the methods that are now available to a zoo to call related to animals?</li>
</ul>


<p>  <code>zoo.animals</code></p>

<ul>
<li>How do I create an animal called &ldquo;jumpster&rdquo; in a zoo called &ldquo;San Diego Zoo&rdquo;?</li>
</ul>


<p>  If in <code>rails console</code> mode:</p>

<pre><code class="``">  $ zoo = Zoo.create(name: "San Diego Zoo")
  $ animal = Animal.create(name: "jumpster")
  $ zoo.animals &lt;&lt; animal  
</code></pre>

<h5>10. What is mass assignment? What&rsquo;s the non-mass assignment way of setting values?</h5>

<p>With mass assignment, we can do
<code>assumption fields: title, body</code>
<code>
@post = Post.new(params[:post])
</code></p>

<p>without mass assignment, we need to do this
<code>
@post = Post.new
post.title = "post title"
post.body = "post body"
</code></p>

<h5>11. What does this code do? <code>Animal.first</code></h5>

<p>Query the first data in table <code>Animal</code>.</p>

<h5>12. If I have a table called &ldquo;animals&rdquo; with columns called &ldquo;name&rdquo;, and a model called <code>Animal</code>, how do I instantiate an animal object with name set to &ldquo;Joe&rdquo;. Which methods makes sure it saves to the database?</h5>

<p>This will make sure it saves to database
<code>
Animal.create(name: "Joe")
</code></p>

<p>And this will work too
<code>
animal = Animal.new(name: "Joe")
animal.save
</code></p>

<h5>13. How does a M:M association work at the database level?</h5>

<p>  There is a join table between two relational tables, and it needs these two tables row data primary key to be its foreign key. For example, there is a join table called post_categories, and it stores two foriegn key named: post_id and category_id.</p>

<h5>14. What are the two ways to support a M:M association at the ActiveRecord model level? Pros and cons of each approach?</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>has_and_belongs_to_many
Chris metioned that this method is deprecated. If you don&rsquo;t need to operate the join table, this method is easy to set up association between two tables. And it&rsquo;s doing a more implicit way.</p></li>
<li><p>has_many through:
You have to define has_many relation with join table, also define has_many through: realtion to both target table and join table. This explicit the way to connect target table and join table. It&rsquo;s much easier to understand all realtionship between tables.</p></li>
</ul>


<h5>15. Suppose we have a User model and a Group model, and we have a M:M association all set up. How do we associate the two?</h5>

<pre><code>user.groups
group.users
</code></pre>

<p>To be honest, I still feel uncomfortable with this week. From week 3, I learned html &amp; css, to week 4, I learned jQuery &amp; Ajax. It&rsquo;s definitely not enough only rely on Codecademy&rsquo;s course, so I decide to do one more app, tic-tac-toe on wep. I think this should make me more comfortable with these lessons.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m wrong, ha!! I still get stuck when doing UI and interactive design. Since I already knew that the most important thing at this moment is becoming a robust rails development, I decide to keep my pace and going to next course.</p>

<p>Recap to this course:</p>

<ul>
<li>week 1, basic Ruby program.</li>
<li>week 2, OOP in Ruby.</li>
<li>week 3, <strong>HTTP is stateless</strong>, HTML &amp; CSS, Sinatra, and Bootstrap.</li>
<li>week 4, jQuery and Ajax.</li>
</ul>


<p>One more thing, I thought I could be a full stack web developer before this course, then I knew I&rsquo;m wrong. There are a lot of knowledge in front end.</p>

<p>And now I have to keep focus on back end.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s realy a tough week for me, because I&rsquo;m totally new to web development.
There are lots of material need to be done:</p>

<ul>
<li>One new concept book: HTTP <a href="https://www.gotealeaf.com/books/http">https://www.gotealeaf.com/books/http</a></li>
<li>Two new languages: HTML &amp; CSS <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/htmlcss">http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/htmlcss</a></li>
<li>Two new frameworks: <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html">Sinatra</a> &amp; <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I think the most important thing in this week is &ldquo;HTTP is stateless&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And using Sinatra show me this property explicit.</p>

<p>Every request in main.rb is independant with each other, using instance variables to store data only survive its scope.</p>

<p>I also write a brief post to memo this property<a href="http://www.tomohung.com/blog/2015/01/14/show-http-is-stateless-by-sinatra/">(HTTP is Stateless)</a>.
Using chache is another way to feel free in thinking programming in the old way.</p>

<p>Though I still use class to complete this assignment, I feel comfortable with this, because I don&rsquo;t need to make a wheel again.</p>

<p>The first struggle in this week is when I saw something like <code>&lt;form action..../&gt;</code>, I have no idea what&rsquo;s this?! because HTML &amp; CSS course in codecademy never metion this. After google that, I found there are plenty of other syntax I didn&rsquo;t know, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp">w3shool</a> help me to know more about HTML.</p>

<p>Another struggle is Sinatra, when I first time read the intro, I totally had no idea what those nouns mean. <code>get '/' {}</code> seems not a nature ruby way; what <code>get</code> <code>post</code> are ??</p>

<p>Following with video and implement functions and pages, then I read Sinatra intro again, this time I feel much clear what its said.</p>

<p>Another horrible thing is on viewing video introduce to modern web development. There are so many tools, concepts, languages need to know. Wow&hellip;</p>

<p>To be a web development, I know I have to keep going.
Moving to Lesson 4.</p>

<p>Finally, here is my blog talking about Reflections for tealeaf lessons.

<p>Although I have some option video not done yet, I want to share some of my reflection.</p>

<p>When I came to lesson 2, first I found that discussion is less than lesson 1 obviously. I think this imply the lesson OOP is harder than before. Thank god I finished three assignments in a week, how I can do this is because:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As a C++ programmer, OOP concept is also the same in Ruby, like inheritance, polymorphism, composition&hellip;etc. Since I have some experience to OOP, familiar with Ruby&rsquo;s style is not a hard work for me.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/books/oo_ruby"><code>Object Oriented Program book</code></a> is fantastic!! I spent one night to read it, then next day I can just start to implement my idea without too much struggles. It clearly explain the relationship between <code>is-a</code> and <code>has-a</code> corresponding to inheritance and mixin.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>And I do fall in love with Ruby, <code>convention</code> is over configuration becomes nature. In lesson 1, it&rsquo;s weird for me to pass a variable into method, but modified or not depends on what actions in the method. Now I start to think it&rsquo;s convenient to decide modified the variable in the method.
<code>attr_accessor</code> is another kind of example, default getter and setter helps a lot to reduce typing time.</p>

<p>Using polymorphism, I don&rsquo;t need to care about how using virtual function, just inheritance class then use it.
Especially for method <code>super</code>, the best way to reduce redundant code.
One suggestion, If subclass&rsquo;s initialize method doesn&rsquo;t use super, then you might think the superclass and subclass relationship is <code>has-a</code>, not <code>is-a</code>.</p>

<p>I do love my <a href="https://github.com/tomohung/tealeaf/blob/master/Lesson2/oo_tic_tac_toe.rb">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tomohung/tealeaf/blob/master/Lesson2/oo_blackjack.rb">Black Jack</a> implemented by OO. In Tic-Tac-Toe, I use polymorphism to implement single player and double players mode. In Black Jack, I add feature that player can play with others NPC together, not just with dealer. This make the game likely in the real world. Without OO concept, these features are hard to implement.</p>

<p>Next lesson is absolutely my challenge, because I&rsquo;m totally new for web development.
But I do look forward to it.</p>

    <id>http://www.tomohung.com/blog/2015/01/01/reflection-to-tealeaf-lesson-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right <a" src="href="http://i.minus.com/ibsevSRoOPCEmU.png">http://i.minus.com/ibsevSRoOPCEmU.png</a>&#8221; width=&#8221;320&#8221;></p>

<p>Happy new year!!</p>

<p>Before I talk about where I struggled with, I would like to say something before I join the course.
I am using C++ for few years, and coding is part of my job. Before join the course, I&rsquo;ve also done the <a href="http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/">Learn Ruby The Hard Way</a> to lesson 45. <code>Learn Ruby The Hard Way</code> is also a good pratice, especially for <code>muscle memory</code>. It focus on <code>just typing ruby</code> when learning ruby knowledge.</p>

<p>After that, I start <code>Prep Course</code> @ tealeaf, reading the book <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/books/ruby"><code>Introduce to Programing</code></a>. <code>Introduction to Programing</code> is also an amazing book, it use a simple way to explain more detail in ruby, and I really did several times &ldquo;Ah ha!&rdquo; when reading it. Then I thought I was ready for lesson 1, but maybe I&rsquo;m wrong :p</p>

<p>About my struggles, as a C++ programmer, there are mainly two &ldquo;What?&rdquo; for ruby:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>variable scope: in C++, every local variable only survive in its scope, but in ruby, this is not always true. Even now, I&rsquo;m still a little confused with that. Glad that I find a way to deal with this: <code>Never use outside variable in insdie scope, make them in different name</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>pointer &amp; reference: when passing a variable to functions(in ruby called: methods), if varaible has prefix like <code>*</code> or <code>&amp;</code>, it obvious means this variable may be modified in this methods. Ruby doesn&rsquo;t take this way, input variables in method could be modified just by what action do inside the method. Fotunately, ruby usaually append suffix <code>!</code> behind method&rsquo;s name to indicate this method modify input variable.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Even these, I do love ruby.</p>

<ul>
<li>There are a lot of built-in convenient methods for String, Array, Hash&hellip;etc. And more are waiting to discover</li>
<li>More fluent phrase for flow control, if, unless, while, until&hellip;etc. Readable code is becoming more and more important.</li>
<li>type less key :p</li>
</ul>


<p>And special Thanks for TA&rsquo;s:
Without their help, I couldn&rsquo;t finished these assignments on time. Because of unfamiliar with ruby methods, wrong code style, improper naming&hellip;etc. They always give me timely advice.</p>

<p>Last, share my experience for developing game <code>Black Jack</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>write psuedo code : 10 min</li>
<li>coding : 2 hours</li>
<li>debugging : 2 hours more</li>
<li>feedback from TA, then refactor: 2 hours</li>
</ul>


<p>By the way, the most difficulty in Lesson 1 is completing &ldquo;Tic-Tac-Toe&rdquo; AI, it tooks me 10 hours more.
If you are totally new to program, don&rsquo;t be disppointed at spending a lot of time, because me too!!
If you are take these assignment as piece of cake, well, let&rsquo;s move to Lesson 2. See you.</p>
